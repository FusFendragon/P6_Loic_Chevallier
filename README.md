## Presentation

This is a project for my formation, i work only on backend, the front was given. I was asked to create an API where wen can create hot sauce, edit/delete and rate them ! I had to be careful on security.

## Installation

Before start you need :

-   create a folder "images" on "backend"
-   rename ".env copy" in ".env" and fill variable inside
-   run `npm install` on "backend"

-   Here are the dependancies you need to install the frontend:

    -   NodeJS 12.14 or 14.0.
    -   Angular CLI 7.0.2.
    -   node-sass : make sure to use the corresponding version to NodeJS. For Noe 14.0 for instance, you need node-sass in version 4.14+.

    On Windows, these installations require to use PowerShell in administrator mode.

    run `npm install` on "frontend".

## Usage

Run `node server` on "backend", you should have "Connexion à MongoDB réussie !" if you well filled ".env".

Run `npm start` on "frontend". This should both run the local server and launch your browser.

If your browser fails to launch, or shows a 404 error, navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080.

The app should reload automatically when you make a change to a file.

Use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the local server.
